# Waypoint-AI-Task1

Hey Andrew, I have my code working now with 3 states all functional with buttons. However, my Chase state is still broken and seems to break the project once it comes into the chase distance. I wasn't sure if this state was essential for the assessment. The WASD control of the player (hexagon) still works, and is to the bottom right off screen.
